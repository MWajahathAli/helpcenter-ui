# Swift Template Repo
Use this as a template repo when creating a new Swift repo for a pipeline release. This contains the update-tag workflow, the snyk file needed, the .mm-attributes file, and the pull request template. 

## Usage
The only change to this template repo that you must make is that you should update the .mm-attributes file with the info for your repo. After that, you may add any files to this. This is designed to reduce maintanance and assure that all repos contain all files we need for manual task automation and compliance. 

## Requests and Support
This repo will be updated if we introduce new files or standards that should be common across all Swift repos.
